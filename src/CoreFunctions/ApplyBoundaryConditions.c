/*! 
 * \brief Applies the boundary conditions specified for each boundary zone.
 *
 * The solver object (of type #HyPar) contains an oject of type #DomainBoundary 
 * that contains all the boundary information (dimension, extent, face, type, etc).
 * This function iterates through each of the boundary zones 
 * (#HyPar::boundary[#HyPar::nBoundaryZones]) and calls the corresponding boundary
 * condition function.
 * \n\n
 * The variable \a flag indicates if the array \a x is the solution, or a delta-solution 
 * (from implicit time-integration methods).
