/*! @brief 1st order upwind reconstruction (component-wise) on a uniform grid

    Computes the interpolated values of the first primitive of a function \f${\bf f}\left({\bf u}\right)\f$
    at the interfaces from the cell-centered values of the function using the 1st order upwind scheme on a 
    uniform grid. The first primitive is defined as a function \f${\bf h}\left({\bf u}\right)\f$ that satisfies:
    \f{equation}{
      {\bf f}\left({\bf u}\left(x\right)\right) = \frac{1}{\Delta x} \int_{x-\Delta x/2}^{x+\Delta x/2} {\bf h}\left({\bf u}\left(\zeta\right)\right)d\zeta,
    \f}
    where \f$x\f$ is the spatial coordinate along the dimension of the interpolation. This function computes the 1st order upwind numerical approximation 
    \f$\hat{\bf f}_{j+1/2} \approx {\bf h}_{j+1/2}\f$ as:
    \f{equation}{
      \hat{\bf f}_{j+1/2} = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} {\bf f}_{j} & {\rm upw} > 0 \\ {\bf f}_{j+1} & {\rm upw} \le 0 \end{array}\right..
    \f}

    \b Implementation \b Notes:
    + The scalar interpolation method is applied to the vector function in a component-wise manner.
    + The function computes the interpolant for the entire grid in one call. It loops over all the grid lines along the interpolation direction
      and carries out the 1D interpolation along these grid lines.
    + Location of cell-centers and cell interfaces along the spatial dimension of the interpolation is shown in the following figure:

    \b Function \b arguments:

    Argument  | Type      | Explanation             
    --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------
    fI        | double*   | Array to hold the computed interpolant at the grid interfaces. This array must have the same layout as the solution, but with \b no \b ghost \b points. Its size should be the same as u in all dimensions, except dir (the dimension along which to interpolate) along which it should be larger by 1 (number of interfaces is 1 more than the number of interior cell centers).
    fC        | double*   | Array with the cell-centered values of the flux function \f${\bf f}\left({\bf u}\right)\f$. This array must have the same layout and size as the solution, \b with \b ghost \b points. 
    u         | double*   | The solution array \f${\bf u}\f$ (with ghost points). If the interpolation is characteristic based, this is needed to compute the eigendecomposition. For a multidimensional problem, the layout is as follows: u is a contiguous 1D array of size (nvars*dim[0]*dim[1]*...*dim[D-1]) corresponding to the multi-dimensional solution, with the following ordering - nvars, dim[0], dim[1], ..., dim[D-1], where nvars is the number of solution components (#HyPar::nvars), dim is the local size (#HyPar::dim_local), D is the number of spatial dimensions.
    x         | double*   | The grid array (with ghost points). This is used only by non-uniform-grid interpolation methods. For multidimensional problems, the layout is as follows: x is a contiguous 1D array of size (dim[0]+dim[1]+...+dim[D-1]), with the spatial coordinates along dim[0] stored from 0,...,dim[0]-1, the spatial coordinates along dim[1] stored along dim[0],...,dim[0]+dim[1]-1, and so forth.
    upw       | int       | Upwinding direction: if positive, a left-biased interpolant will be computed; if negative, a right-biased interpolant will be computed. If the interpolation method is central, then this has no effect.
    dir       | int       | Spatial dimension along which to interpolate (eg: 0 for 1D; 0 or 1 for 2D; 0,1 or 2 for 3D)
    s         | void*     | Solver object of type #HyPar: the following variables are needed - #HyPar::ghosts, #HyPar::ndims, #HyPar::nvars, #HyPar::dim_local.
    m         | void*     | MPI object of type #MPIVariables: this is needed only by compact interpolation method that need to solve a global implicit system across MPI ranks.
    uflag     | int       | A flag indicating if the function being interpolated \f${\bf f}\f$ is the solution itself \f${\bf u}\f$ (if 1, \f${\bf f}\left({\bf u}\right) \equiv {\bf u}\f$).
