3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

Inviscid Advection of a Density Wave: 

This test case is inviscid, and therefore, does not test the
viscous terms implementation.

Domain: 

  0 <= x,y,z <= 1.0
  "periodic" boundary conditions

Initial/Exact Solution:

  Freestream conditions -
  
    rho_inf = 1.0,        drho = 0.1
    p_inf   = 1.0/gamma
    u_inf   = 1.0
    v_inf   = 1.0
    w_inf   = 1.0

    rho1 = mf1 * rho
    rho2 = mf2 * rho
    where rho(x,y,z) = rho_inf + drho * sin(x) * cos(y)
    p(x,y,z) = p_inf
    u(x,y,z) = u_inf
    v(x,y,z) = v_inf
    w(x,y,z) = v_inf

  where mf1 and mf2 are the mass fractions
  of each species, mf1 + mf2 = 1.

This example considers a two-species setup, with the species 
decoupled from each other. The initial solution specifies the
initial mass fraction of each species. The overall solution
should be the same as the single-species density wave advection.
(Dummy problem to test the multispecies code implementation)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ lusolver.inp  -   Parameters for the tridiagonal solver
                    required for a compact scheme

The code aux/exact.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file (initial.inp) and exact solution file (exact.inp)
in the correct format required by the solver. 

Compile and run this code to generate these files.
