2D EULER EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]    d  [   rho*v   ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] +  -- [  rho*u*v  ] = 0
  dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [   rho*u*v  ]    dy [rho*v*v + p]
      [   e   ]       [   (e+p)*u  ]       [  (e+p)v   ]

  rho   - density
  u     - x-velocity
  v     - y-velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
        gamma-1      2


Radial Expansion Wave problem:

http://www.as.dlr.de/hiocfd/case_c1.5.html

Domain:

  -4.0 <= x,y <= 4.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions
  (supersonic outflow)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution are not provided. It can be generated 
by compiling aux/init.C running the executable in the 
run directory (where solver.inp is present).

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.

Tecplot users can use the file solution.lay to visualize the
solution.
