2D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]    d  [   rho*v   ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] +  -- [  rho*u*v  ] = viscous and gravity terms
  dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [   rho*u*v  ]    dy [rho*v*v + p]
      [   e   ]       [   (e+p)*u  ]       [  (e+p)v   ]

  rho   - density
  u     - x-velocity
  v     - y-velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
        gamma-1      2


Inviscid Advection of a Density Wave: 

  0 <= x,y <= 1.0
  "periodic" boundary conditions

Initial/Exact Solution:

  Freestream conditions -
  
    rho_inf = 1.0,        drho = 0.1
    p_inf   = 1.0/gamma
    u_inf   = 1.0
    v_inf   = 1.0

    rho     = rho_inf + drho * sin(x) * cos(y)
    p       = p_inf
    u       = u_inf
    v       = v_inf


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ lusolver.inp  -   Parameters for the tridiagonal solver
                    required for a compact scheme

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

The code aux/exact.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file (initial.inp) and exact solution file (exact.inp)
in the correct format required by the solver. 

Compile and run this code to generate these files.

Tecplot users can use the file solution.lay to visualize the
solution.
