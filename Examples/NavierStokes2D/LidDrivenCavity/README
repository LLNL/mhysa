Domain:

  0 <= x,y <= 1.0
  "no-slip wall" BC on the left, bottom and right boundaries
  "moving wall" BC on the top boundary

Note that this is an incompressible problem being solved here using the compressible 
Navier-Stokes equations in terms of non-dimensional flow variables. The density and 
pressure are taken such that the speed of sound is 1.0, and the flow velocities specified 
in the initial and boundary conditions correspond to a characteristic Mach number of 0.1 
(thus, they are 0.1 times the values in the above reference).

Initial Solution: See references.


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution is not provided. It can be generated 
by compiling aux/init.c and running the executable in the 
run directory (where solver.inp is present).

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
