2D LINEAR ADVECTION

  du        du       du
  --  + a_x -- + a_y --  = 0
  dt        dx       dy

  0 <= x,y <= 1; Periodic
  a_x = advection speed along x
  a_y = advection speed along y

Initial Solution:

  u(x,y,0) = sin (2 pi x) cos (2 pi y) 

Exact solution:

  u(x,y,t) = sin (2 pi x - a_x t) cos (2 pi y - a_y t) 

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
                    (advection speed along each dimension)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/exact.c is an example to generate the initial
(and exact) solution file(s) in the correct format required 
by the solver.
