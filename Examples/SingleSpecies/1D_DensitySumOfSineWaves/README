1D EULER EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] = 0
  dt  [   e   ]   dx  [ (e+p)*u    ]

  rho   - density
  u     - velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * u^2
        gamma-1      2

Advection of Density Wave: Sum of Sine Waves

Domain:

  -0.5 <= x < 0.5
  "periodic" boundary conditions

Exact Solution:

    rho = 1.0 + 0.01 * \Sum_k^{N/2} A(k)*sin(2*pi*k*(x-t))
    u   = 1.0
    p   = 1/gamma

where N is the number of grid points.

Thus, time period is 1.0

This example is useful to analyze the spectral properties 
of a reconstruction scheme.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)

** See mhysa/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/exact.c is an example to generate the initial and
exact solution files in the correct format required by the solver. 

The code aux/fourier.c can be used to calculate the initial and
final spectrum of the solution. It needs the fftw3 library
(http://www.fftw.org). To compile:
g++ -I/path/to/fftw3.h -L/path/to/libfftw3.a -lfftw3 -lm fourier.c
