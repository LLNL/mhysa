3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

2D Riemann Problem (Case 4) along the XY plane:

+ P. Lax and X.-D. Liu, Solution of two-dimensional Riemann 
  problems of gas dynamics by positive schemes, 
  SIAM J Sci Comp 19 (1998), 319â€“340.

Domain:

  -0.5 <= x,y,z <= 0.5
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions along x,y
  "periodic" boundary conditions along z

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution are not provided. It can be generated by 
compiling aux/init.c and running the executable in the run 
directory (where solver.inp is present).
