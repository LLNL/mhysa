3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

Rising Thermal Bubble Problem: represents a warm bubble in cool
ambient atmosphere that rises due to buoyancy. In this example,
the gravitational force acts along the y-axis.

Domain:

  0 <= x,y,z <= 1000
  "slip-walls" boundary conditions at all boundaries

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution file (can be generated
                    by compiling and running aux/init.c in
                    the run directory).

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Visualizing the solution in Tecplot or MATLAB:
1)  Make sure op_file_format is set to binary in solver.inp.
2)  Compile and run aux/PostProcess.c after the simulation is
    over.
3a) Choose text output and plot in MATLAB using PlotSolution.m
*or*
3b) Choose Tecplot output and plot in Tecplot. 

Extracting a slice and visualizing it:
1)  Make sure op_file_format is set to binary in solver.inp.
2) Create a subdirectory called "slices".
3) Compile and run hypar/Extras/ExtractSlice.c (and let it extract
   the slice along dimension "2", i.e. "z", so that it extracts
   an x-y slice). The slices will be written in binary format.
4) In the subdirectory slices, create a copy of solver.inp
   and physics.inp. Modify them to strip off the z-dimension:
   - in solver.inp, set "ndims" to 2, and remove the z-dimension
     for "size" and "iproc".
   - in physics.inp, remove the 3rd component of "gravity"
5) Compile and run aux/PostProcessSlice.c to convert the binary
   solution file for the slices to Tecplot or plain text files.
   Visualize in Tecplot or MATLAB, respectively.
