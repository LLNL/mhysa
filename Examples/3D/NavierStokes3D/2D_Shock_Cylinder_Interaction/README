Interaction of a normal shock with a 2D cylinder (Inviscid)

+ O. Boiron, G. Chiavassa, R. Donat, A high-resolution 
  penalization method for large Mach number flows in the
  presence of obstacles, Computers & Fluids, 38 (2009),
  pp. 703-714, Section 5.1

Domain:
  -2.5 <= x <= 7.5
  -5   <= y <= 5
  Length of the domain along z is very small and with only 3 grid points

Immersed body: Cylinder of radius 1, centered at (0,0).

Boundary Conditions: 
+ xmin: Subsonic inflow
+ xmax: Supersonic inflow
+ ymin and ymax: Slip walls
+ zmin and zmax: Periodic

Initial solution: see reference

Other parameters:
  gamma = 1.4
  shock Mach number = 3.0

Final time: 2.0

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution file (can be generated
                    by compiling and running aux/init.c in
                    the run directory).
+ cylinder.stl  -   Copy from hypar/Examples/STLGeometries/cylinder.stl
NOTE: The cylinder geometry must be specified as a STL file.

Visualization:
+ If "op_file_format" is set to "tecplot3d", the solution files can be
  visualized in any software that reads in the Tecplot format (eg., 
  Tecplot, VisIt, Paraview, etc)
+ If the "op_file_format" is set to "text", the solution files are ASCII
  text files with the following columns: i-index, j-index, k-index,
  x-coordinate, y-coordinate, z-coordinate, rho, rho*u, rho*v, rho*w, E.
+ If the "op_file_format is set to "binary", the solutions are written
  to binary files.
  - hypar/Extras/BinaryToTecplot.c - use this code to convert to a Tecplot
    format solution file.
  - hypar/Extras/BinaryToText.c - use this code to convert to a plain text
    format solution file.
  - hypar/Extras/ExtractSlice.c - use this code to extract a 2D slice normal
    to a specified dimension at a specified position along that dimension.
    The output will be binary solution files (with the same names) written
    to a subdirectory "slices" (NOTE: create the subdirectory "slices" 
    before using this). The binary solution files for the slices can then
    be converted to Tecplot or text formats using the above codes. This 
    needs the relevant solver.inp in the slices subdirectory that can be 
    created as follows:
    + Copy the original solver.inp to the slices subdirectory.
    + In this solver.inp, set ndims as 2, and remove the component of size and 
      iproc corresponding to the dimension being eliminated while extracting 
      the slices (in this case, it is z or the 3rd component).
