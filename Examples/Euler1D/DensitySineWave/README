1D EULER EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] = 0
  dt  [   e   ]   dx  [ (e+p)*u    ]

  rho   - density
  u     - velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * u^2
        gamma-1      2

Density Wave Advection

Domain:

  0 <= x < 1.0
  "periodic" boundary conditions

Exact Solution:

    rho = 1.0 + 0.1*sin(2*pi*(x-t))
    u   = 1.0
    p   = 1.0/gamma

    Thus, time period is 1.0

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional, used to compute error)
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/exact.C is an example to generate the initial 
and exact solution files in the correct format required by 
the solver.
