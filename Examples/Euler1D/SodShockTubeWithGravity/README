1D EULER EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS WITH GRAVITY

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]   [   0      ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] = [ -rho*g   ]
  dt  [   e   ]   dx  [ (e+p)*u    ]   [ -rho*u*g ]

  rho   - density
  u     - velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  g     - acceleration due to gravity

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * u^2
        gamma-1      2

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 1.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:

  0 <= x < 0.5

    rho = 1.0
    u   = 0
    p   = 1.0

  0.5 <= x <= 1.0

    rho = 0.125
    u   = 0
    p   = 0.1

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
