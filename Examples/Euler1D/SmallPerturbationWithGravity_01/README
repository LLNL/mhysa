  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]   [   0      ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] = [ -rho*g   ]

  rho   - density
  u     - velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  g     - acceleration due to gravity

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * u^2
        gamma-1      2

Well Balanced Test and Small Perturbation of Equilibrium:

  This test case simulates 1D flow in isothermal equilibrium, 
  with a specified initial pressure perturbation. The strength
  of the perturbation is specified by eta in aux/init.c. For 
  zero perturbation (eta=0.0), the simulation should show
  machine-zero residuals.

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 1.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:

  rho = exp(-x)
  p   = exp(-x) + eta * exp( -100*(x-0.5)^2 )


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
