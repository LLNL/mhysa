3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

2D Riemann Problem (Case 4) along the XZ plane:

+ P. Lax and X.-D. Liu, Solution of two-dimensional Riemann 
  problems of gas dynamics by positive schemes, 
  SIAM J Sci Comp 19 (1998), 319â€“340.

Domain:

  -0.5 <= x,y,z <= 0.5
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution are not provided. It can be generated by 
compiling aux/init.C and running the executable in the run 
directory (where solver.inp is present).

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.

Tecplot users can use the file solution.lay to visualize the
solution.
