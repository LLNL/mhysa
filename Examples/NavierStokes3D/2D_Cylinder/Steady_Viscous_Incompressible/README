Domain:

  Uniform grid in the following region:
  -2 <= x <= 6
  -2 <= y <= 2
  Stretched mesh beyond that (location of actual
  boundary depends on stretching ratio and number
  of points - as far as possible)

  Length of the domain along z is very small and with only 3 grid points

Immersed body: Cylinder of radius 1, centered at (0,0).

Boundary Conditions: 
+ xmin: Subsonic inflow
+ xmax: Subsonic outflow
+ ymin and ymax: Subsonic "ambivalent"
+ zmin and zmax: Periodic

Initial solution:
    rho = 1.0
    u   = 0.1
    v   = 0.0
    w   = 0.0
    p   = 1/gamma
  everywhere in the domain

Other parameters:
  gamma = 1.4
  freestream Mach number = 0.1
  Prandtl number = 0.72
  Reynolds number = 10 (cylinder-diameter-based Reynolds number = 20)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution file (can be generated
                    by compiling and running aux/init.c in
                    the run directory).
+ cylinder.stl  -   Copy from hypar/Examples/STLGeometries/cylinder.stl
NOTE: The cylinder geometry must be specified as a STL file.

Visualization of the main solution:

+ If "op_file_format" is set to "tecplot3d", the solution files can be
  visualized in any software that reads in the Tecplot format (eg., 
  Tecplot, VisIt, Paraview, etc)
+ If the "op_file_format" is set to "text", the solution files are ASCII
  text files with the following columns: i-index, j-index, k-index,
  x-coordinate, y-coordinate, z-coordinate, rho, rho*u, rho*v, rho*w, E.
+ If the "op_file_format is set to "binary", the solutions are written
  to binary files.
  - hypar/Extras/BinaryToTecplot.c - use this code to convert to a Tecplot
    format solution file.
  - hypar/Extras/BinaryToText.c - use this code to convert to a plain text
    format solution file.
  - hypar/Extras/ExtractSlice.c - use this code to extract a 2D slice normal
    to a specified dimension at a specified position along that dimension.
    The output will be binary solution files (with the same names) written
    to a subdirectory "slices" (NOTE: create the subdirectory "slices" 
    before using this). The binary solution files for the slices can then
    be converted to Tecplot or text formats using the above codes. This 
    needs the relevant solver.inp in the slices subdirectory that can be 
    created as follows:
    + Copy the original solver.inp to the slices subdirectory.
    + In this solver.inp, set ndims as 2, and remove the component of size and 
      iproc corresponding to the dimension being eliminated while extracting 
      the slices (in this case, it is z or the 3rd component).

Visualization of the Immersed Body:
In addition to the main solution (op*.*), there will be a file surface*.dat
(if op_overwrite is set to "yes", then surface.dat, else surface_nnnnn.dat,
where nnnnn is a numerical index). This file contains the surface aerodynamic
forces on the immersed body in Tecplot format - the data is written in the
unstructured finite-element triangle format. This file can be opened and
visualized in any software that can read Tecplot format.
