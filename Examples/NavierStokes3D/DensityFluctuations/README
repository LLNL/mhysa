3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

Inviscid Advection of Density Fluctuations with a specified initial spectrum

Domain:

  -0.5 <= x,y,z < 0.5
  "periodic" boundary conditions

The initial solution is specified in the Fourier space (with an energy
distribution similar to that of turbulent flow), and then transformed 
to the physical space through an inverse transform.

This example is useful to analyze the spectral properties 
of a reconstruction scheme.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.C)
+ exact.inp     -   Make exact.inp a symbolic link pointing 
                    to initial.inp

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/exact.C is an example to generate the initial solution
file in the correct format required by the solver.  

The code aux/fourier.C can be used to calculate the initial and
final spectrum of the solution. 

** Both these codes need the fftw3 library (http://www.fftw.org). 
To compile:
g++ -I/path/to/fftw3.h -L/path/to/libfftw3.a -lfftw3 fourier.C
