3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

Inviscid Isentropic Vortex Convection:

Vortex axis is along the X-axis and convects along Y; thus this
problem is equivalent to a 2D problem in the YZ plane.

This test case is inviscid, and therefore, does not test the
viscous terms implementation.

Domain:

  0 <= x,y,z <= 10.0
  "periodic" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:

  Freestream conditions -
  
    rho = 1.0
    p   = 1.0/gamma
    u   = 0.0
    v   = 0.5
    w   = 0.0

  Vortex centered at y0 = 5.0, z0 = 5.0 - 

                (gamma-1)*b^2                   1     
    rho = ( 1 - ------------- exp(1-r^2) ) ^ (-------)   
                8*gamma*pi^2                  gamma-1 

    p   = rho^gamma

    du  =  0

             b        1-r^2
    dv  = - --- exp [ ----- ] + (z-z0)^2
            2pi         2

             b        1-r^2
    dw  =   --- exp [ ----- ] + (y-y0)^2
            2pi         2

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ lusolver.inp  -   Parameters for the tridiagonal solver
                    when using compact schemes.

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution (and exact.inp if exact solution is 
desired) are not provided. They can be generated by 
compiling aux/init.C and aux/exact.C and running the
executables in the run directory (where solver.inp is
present).

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.

Tecplot users can use the file solution.lay to visualize the
solution.
