Sod's Shock Tube Problem with Two Non-Reacting Species

+ G.A. Sod, "A survey of several finite difference methods 
  for systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws," 
  J. Comput. Phys., 27, 1 (1978).

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 1.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:

  0 <= x < 0.5

    rho1 = mf1*1.0
    rho2 = mf2*1.0
    u   = 0
    p   = 1.0

  0.5 <= x <= 1.0

    rho1 = mf1*0.125
    rho2 = mf2*0.125
    u   = 0
    p   = 0.1

  where mf1 and mf2 are the mass fractions
  of each species, mf1 + mf2 = 1.

This example considers a two-species setup, with the species 
decoupled from each other. The initial solution specifies the
initial mass fraction of each species. The overall solution
should be the same as the single-species shock tube.
(Dummy problem to test the multispecies code implementation)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
