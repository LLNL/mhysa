Initial solution:
  \f{equation}{
    u\left(x,0\right) = \left\{\begin{array}{lc} 
                          \exp\left(-\log\left(2\right)\frac{\left(x+7\right)^2}{0.0009}\right) & -0.8\le x \le -0.6 \\

Numerical Method:
 + Spatial discretization (hyperbolic): 5th order CRWENO (Interp1PrimFifthOrderCRWENO())
 + Time integration: SSPRK3 (TimeRK(), #_RK_SSP3_)

Input files required:
---------------------

\b solver.inp
\include 1D/LinearAdvection/DiscontinuousWaves/solver.inp

\b boundary.inp
\include 1D/LinearAdvection/DiscontinuousWaves/boundary.inp

\b physics.inp
\include 1D/LinearAdvection/DiscontinuousWaves/physics.inp

\b lusolver.inp (optional)
\include 1D/LinearAdvection/DiscontinuousWaves/lusolver.inp

\b weno.inp (optional)
\include 1D/LinearAdvection/DiscontinuousWaves/weno.inp

To generate \b initial.inp, compile and run the 
following code in the run directory. \b Note: if the
final time is an integer multiple of the time period,
the file \b initial.inp can also be used as the exact
solution \b exact.inp (i.e. create a sym link called 
\a exact.inp pointing to \a initial.inp, or just copy
\a initial.inp to \a exact.inp).
\include 1D/LinearAdvection/DiscontinuousWaves/aux/init.c

Output:
-------
After running the code, there should be two solution output
files \b op_00000.dat and \b op_00001.dat; the first one is
the initial solution, and the latter is the final solution.
Both these files are ASCII text (#HyPar::op_file_format is
set to \a text in \b solver.inp).

Final solution at t=2.0: The following figure is obtained 
by plotting \a op_00000.dat (initial) and \a op_00001.dat
(final). In both these files, the first column is grid 
index, the second column is x-coordinate, and the third 
column is the solution.

Domain: \f$0 \le x \le 1.0\f$, \a "extrapolate" (#_EXTRAPOLATE_) 
        boundary conditions

Initial Solution:
  + \f$ 0 \le x < 0.5\f$: \f$\rho = 1, u = 0, p = 1\f$
  + \f$ 0.5 \le x \le 1\f$: \f$\rho = 0.125, u = 0, p = 0.1\f$

Numerical Method:
 + Spatial discretization (hyperbolic): Characteristic-based 5th order WENO (Interp1PrimFifthOrderWENOChar())
 + Time integration: RK4 (TimeRK(), #_RK_44_)

\b solver.inp:

Final solution at t=0.2: The following figure is obtained 
by plotting \a op_00001.dat. Note that the output is in
terms of the conserved variables, so they have to converted
to the primitive variables (density, velocity, and pressure).
